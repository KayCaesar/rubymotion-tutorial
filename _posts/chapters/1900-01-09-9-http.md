# An Introduction to HTTP

We've covered the building blocks of UI on iOS, but most of the time we want to populate our interface with some data from a server. The Apple-prescribed method of doing this is to use `NSURLConnection`, which is a very powerful but verbose class for sending HTTP requests; instead, we're going to use a new-fangled RubyMotion library called `BubbleWrap`.

## BubbleWrap It Up

As we mentioned earlier, [BubbleWrap][bw] is a collection of idiomatic Ruby wrappers for the iOS SDK. If you haven't noticed, a lot of Apple's APIs use a system of calling established methods on a callback object. Thus, many of BubbleWrap's wrappers are just moving those callback methods into `lambda`s and `block`s. The `BubbleWrap::HTTP` wrapper we're going to use is an example of that.

Remember to add the requirement in your `Rakefile` so you're good to go:

```ruby
$:.unshift("/Library/RubyMotion/lib")
require 'motion/project'
require 'bubble-wrap'

...
```

The `BubbleWrap::HTTP` library uses functions for each HTTP request method: `HTTP.get`, `HTTP.post`, `HTTP.put`, etc. Each method takes as arguments a string URL, an options hash, and a callback block for when the request finishes. Here are some short and sweet examples:

```ruby
BubbleWrap::HTTP.get("http://google.com") do |response|
  p response.body.to_str
end

# BW is alias for BubbleWrap
BW::HTTP.get("http://www.bing.com/search", payload: {q: "some query"}) do |response|
  # sends request to http://www.bing.com/search?q=some+query
end

BW::HTTP.post("https://graph.facebook.com/123123123/comments", payload: {message: "This is a comment"}) do |response|
  # sends request to https://graph.facebook.com/123123123/comments
  # with body params `message=This is a comment`
end
```

Looks pretty nice, right? We can add more information to our requests (like files, headers, HTTP auth credentials), but the APIs we're going to play with just use GET and POSTs. (you can check the full [HTTP documentation][docs] for details)

Wait a second, what are we actually going to make?
