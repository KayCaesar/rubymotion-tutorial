# Controllers

We've done some work with views, but they are but one leg of the "Model-View-Controller" paradigm the iOS SDK uses. That sounds really fancy, but it's actually pretty simple.

The idea is that in your code you should have three types of classes: views (which yup, you've already seen), models (which represent and handle data), and....controllers.

So, what are controllers? They're objects which act as a "layer" between models and views, interpreting events from the user to change the models and update the views in response. In a perfectly coded world, when you tap a button the controller intercepts that event, updates a property of the data, and changes the view to reflect the new data.

That sounds kind of "big picture", but there are some really practical reasons for controllers:

- **View reuse**. Let's say we have a `PostView` which displays all the information about a `Post` (its content, author, "Likes", etc). We want to use this view on a couple of different screens, such as a main feed and a user's profile feed. To stay reusable, the `PostView` shouldn't deal with *how* it gets the information; instead, its controller should take care of that and then pass the processed data on to the view.
- **Presentation management**. Sometimes we want a view to take up the entire screen, other times we want the same thing to appear in a modal box (think iPad vs iPhone). It doesn't make sense to write two identical view classes that differ only in presentation style, so we use the controllers to resize and animate our views accordingly.

There's nothing technically stopping you from doing those things inside models and views, but it makes your code much more robust and easier to manage if you embrace MVC.

In iOS-land, controllers are `UIViewController`s. They come with one `view` property and methods for dealing with things like the view "lifecycle" and handling orientation changes. Don't fret, we'll get to the lifecycle business soon enough.

So now that we know what a controller is and what it should do, what *shouldn't* it do?

- Directly query or save data. It's tempting to send a bunch of HTTP requests in a controller, but those are best left to your models.
- Complex view layouts. If you're directly adding subviews more than one level "deep" to your controller's `view`, you should rewrite your views to do it themselves. As a good rule of thumb, the only `addSubview` you should see in your controller is `self.view.addSubview`.

OK that's enough exposition, time for the Michael Bay action sequences.

## Everything Is Under Controllers

Create the `./app/controllers` directory (`mkdir ./app/controllers`) and add a `TapController.rb` file inside. Let's start to define our controller like so:

```ruby
class TapController < UIViewController
  def viewDidLoad
    super

    self.view.backgroundColor = UIColor.redColor
  end
end
```

`viewDidLoad` is one of those "lifecycle" methods of `UIViewController`, which is called after `self.view` has been created and is ready for subviews to be added. For now, we just make its background color red and call it a day.

You *absolutely*, *must*, *without question* call `super` in `viewDidLoad`, or else bad things will happen. Got it? Cool.

Now, go back to your `AppDelegate` and remove our old `UIView` code. We just need to add one line so it looks like this:

```ruby
class AppDelegate
  def application(application, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:launchOptions)
    @window = UIWindow.alloc.initWithFrame(UIScreen.mainScreen.bounds)
    @window.makeKeyAndVisible

    # This is our new line!
    @window.rootViewController = TapController.alloc.initWithNibName(nil, bundle: nil)

    true
  end
end
```

See the `rootViewController=` call? The window will take the given `UIViewController` and adjust its `view`'s size to fit the window. *This* is the better way of setting up your window (as opposed to `window.addSubview` everywhere).

The other new part of that line is `initWithNibName:bundle:`. Typically, this is used to load a controller from a `NIB` file. `NIB`s are created using Xcode's Interface Builder as a way of visually constructing your view. Since we aren't using Interface Builder for our controller, we can safely pass nil for both arguments.

`initWithNibName:bundle:` is also the "designated initializer" of `UIViewController`s. Whenever you want to create a controller, you *must* call this method at some point, especially in any customized initializer methods.

Since that's out of the way, `rake` and check it out. You should see something like this:

Big things have small beginnings. Let's make one small change to our controller:

```ruby
  def viewDidLoad
    super

    self.view.backgroundColor = UIColor.whiteColor

    @label = UILabel.alloc.initWithFrame(CGRectZero)
    @label.text = "Taps"
    @label.sizeToFit
    @label.center = CGPointMake(self.view.frame.size.width / 2, self.view.frame.size.height / 2)
    self.view.addSubview @label
  end
```

A wild `UILabel` appeared! `UILabel`s are views meant for displaying static text with their `text` property. We create one, set its text to "Taps", and add it as a subview.

We use the `CGRectZero` frame when we initialize it because we don't know the exact dimensions of the text on the screen yet; however, when we call `sizeToFit` the label resizes itself to perfectly fit its contents. Then we use the handy `center` property to center it in our controller's view.

`rake` again for a much pleasant-looking app. It doesn't really do...anything right now, but in the next chapter we'll make it do...stuff.

## Wrap Up

What did we learn this time?

- The iOS SDK uses the Model-View-Controller paradigm.
- `UIViewController` makes up the controller part of that, and it should be subclassed for customization.
- Use `viewDidLoad` when to setup your controller and *don't forget to call *super*.
- `UIWindow`s have a `rootViewController` property for displaying controllers.
