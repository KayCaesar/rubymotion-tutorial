# Containers

Now that we have a big white screen on our hands, let's dress it up.

If you've used more than a handful of iOS apps, you've undoubtedly noticed some visual similarities. Primarily, many apps have a black bottom bar with tabs and a blue top bar with a title. These are the standard "containers" in iOS, known as `UITabBarController` and `UINavigationController` respectively. We're going to play with them.

These containers are `UIViewController` subclasses which actually manage other `UIViewController`s. Kind of wild, right? They have a `view` just like regular controllers, to which these "children" controllers' views are added as subviews. Thankfully, we never really have to worry about *how* that works, as these container controllers have pleasant APIs that deal with controllers, not views.

## UINavigationController

Let's start with the most common container, `UINavigationController`. It manages its children controllers as a stack, pushing and popping them along a visually horizontal path. Mail.app uses one for its flow from Accounts -> An Account -> Inbox -> Message. The navigation controller is really nice in that automatically it'll handle the back button for you; all you need to do is push and pop controllers.

In `AppDelegate`, change our `rootViewController` assignment to use a `UINavigationController`:

```ruby
  ...
  controller = TapController.alloc.initWithNibName(nil, bundle: nil)
  @window.rootViewController = UINavigationController.alloc.initWithRootViewController(controller)
  ...
```

`initWithRootViewController` will take the controller passed to it and start the stack with it.

And make one more change before we run the app, in `TapController`:

```ruby
  ...
  self.view.addSubview @label

  self.title = "Tap"
  ...
```

`rake` and check out our slightly prettier app:

Sweet. Now let's make it do something. We're going to add a navigation bar button that pushes more instances of `TapController`s onto the navigation controller stack.

You can actually put buttons in the navigation bar at the top of the screen. For example, Mail.app does this for the "Edit" button. These buttons are instances of `UIBarButtonItem`, which has loads of configuration options (want to use text? an image? a system icon? all sorts of fun stuff).

In `TapController`, add the button in `viewDidLoad`:

```ruby
def viewDidLoad
  ...
  self.title = "Tap"

  right_button = UIBarButtonItem.alloc.initWithTitle("Push", style: UIBarButtonItemStyleBordered, target:self, action:'push')
  self.navigationItem.rightBarButtonItem = right_button
end
```

Should be pretty plain what this does. We create a `UIBarButtonItem` instance with a title and a style. The `style` property determines how our button looks (either plain, bordered, or "done"; play around to see the differences). We then set it as our controller's `navigationItem`'s `rightBarButtonItem`. Every `UIViewController` has a `navigationItem`, which is how we access the information displayed in the blue bar at the top. (NOTE that `UINavigationItem` *isn't* a `UIView`! so you can't arbitrarily add subviews to it).

What's the `target`/`action` business? Well, this is where the original Objective-C SDK leaks into Ruby-land =(. Up until very recently, you couldn't pass anonymous functions as callbacks in Objective-C; as an alternative, APIs would pass objects and the name of a function to call on that object. We `do` this operation in Ruby with blocks and lambdas, but sadly the older iOS APIs show their age.

Anyway, `target` is the object you want to call the `action` function on. Let's implement it in our `TapController` so you get a better idea:

```ruby
...
  def push
    new_controller = TapController.alloc.initWithNibName(nil, bundle: nil)
    self.navigationController.pushViewController(new_controller, animated: true)
  end
...
```

Make more sense now? When the user taps the bar button, `push` gets called on the `target`, which in this case is our controller.

In addition to `navigationItem`, `UIViewController`s also have a property for their `navigationController`, if available. On the nav controller we call `pushViewController` which pushes the passed controller onto the stack. By default, the navigation controller will also show a back button which handles popping the current controller for us (normally we call `popViewControllerAnimated:` on the navigation controller). Kind of neat, right?

Let's have one last bit of fun before we run the app. Have the controller's title reflect its position in the navigation stack, like so:

```ruby
  def viewDidLoad
    ...
    self.title = "Tap (#{self.navigationController.viewControllers.count})"
    ...
  end
```

Now `rake` and observe our dynamic controllers!

Now, I said we'd cover `UITabController`s too, so let's get to it.

## UITabBarController

![Navigation controller in Mail.app](images/tab_bar.png)

Tab controllers are a lot like `UINavigationController` and other container controllers: it has a list of `viewControllers` which are presented within the container's "chrome" (the black bar). However, unlike the other containers, `UITabBarController`s are only supposed to act as the `rootViewController` of the window (i.e. you shouldn't push a tab bar controller inside a navigation controller).

In `AppDelegate`, let's make a small change:

```ruby
  ...
  controller = TapController.alloc.initWithNibName(nil, bundle: nil)
  nav_controller = UINavigationController.alloc.initWithRootViewController(controller)

  tab_controller = UITabBarController.alloc.initWithNibName(nil, bundle: nil)
  tab_controller.viewControllers = [nav_controller]
  @window.rootViewController = tab_controller
  ...
```

Unlike other code examples, this doesn't have anything new! We create the `UITabBarController` like a normal `UIViewController` and set its `viewControllers` to an array with our navigation controller.

`rake` and check it out!

![tab bar controller](images/3.png)

Kind of...underwhelming, I guess. Let's start to pretty it up by adding an icon to our tab bar.

Much like `navigationItem`, every `UIViewController` has a `tabBarItem` property, which accepts an instance of `UITabBarItem`. We can use this object to customize the icon, title, and other appearance options of our controller's tab.

Override `initWithNibName:bundle:` in TapController, and go ahead and create such an object:

```ruby
  ...
  def initWithNibName(name, bundle: bundle)
    super
    self.tabBarItem = UITabBarItem.alloc.initWithTabBarSystemItem(UITabBarSystemItemFavorites, tag: 1)
    self
  end
  ...
```

This is one initializer for `UITabBarItem`; you can also use `initWithTitle:image:tag:` if you want to supply a custom image and title. If you do use a custom image, it needs to be a 30x30 black and transparent icon.

`initWithTabBarSystemItem:` makes our lives a little easier for demonstrating a tab icon, but it will force the title to correspond to the system's image (in this case, "Favorites").

Why do we put it in `initWithNibName:bundle:`? Because we want it to create the `tabBarItem` as soon as the controller exists, regardless of whether or not its `view` exists. If you put it in `viewDidLoad`, then it might not get created when the app launches (tab bar controllers only load each child controller when its first accessed by the user).

One more thing! Let's make another tab. We don't really have anything to do in this other tab yet, so let's just make an empty `UIViewController` with a different background color in `AppDelegate`:

```ruby
  ...
  other_controller = UIViewController.alloc.initWithNibName(nil, bundle: nil)
  other_controller.title = "Other"
  other_controller.view.backgroundColor = UIColor.purpleColor

  tab_controller = UITabBarController.alloc.initWithNibName(nil, bundle: nil)
  tab_controller.viewControllers = [nav_controller, other_controller]
  @window.rootViewController = tab_controller
  ...
```

`rake` and voila! A whole bunch of container controllers! They don't do a whole lot, but you can easily see how these few classes form the building blocks of 80% of iOS apps.

## Subway Up

Let's rundown what we covered:

- The iOS SDK uses `UINavigationController`s and `UITabBarController`s for containing "child" view controllers.
- `UINavigationController` uses 'pushViewController:animated:' and 'popViewControllerAnimated:' to control the stack.
- Use `controller.navigationItem` to change the buttons and other options of the top blue bar for a controller.
- `UITabBarController` uses `viewControllers=` to control its children; note that `UITabBarController` should *only* be used as the `rootViewController` of a window.
- Use `controller.tabBarItem` to change the tab icon and title displayed for that controller.
